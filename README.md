# Ionic simple weather app

App that discovers temperature based on user position. This app is based on [this](http://tableless.com.br/tutorial-ionic-meu-primeiro-app/) tutorial.

* Make sure you have installed [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).

* On `www/js/app.js` change the variable `var api_key = "YOUR-KEY";`, for your [DarkSky](https://darksky.net/dev) API key.

* Run `npm install`

* Run `ionic serve` (The geolocation methods are deprecated in Chromium version 50 and higher. Use another browser or older Chromium for tests)

* Enjoy
